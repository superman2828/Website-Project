            <h2>Step-by-Step instructions:</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace</b><br>
                Before you touch any components, set up a clean, flat workspace. A large table with good lighting is ideal. Make sure you're working on a non-carpeted surface if possible to avoid static electricity. If you have an anti-static wrist strap, wear it. If not, just ground yourself by touching metal (like your PC case) regularly during the build.                
                <br><br>                
                <b>Step 2: Install the CPU</b><br>
                Open your motherboard box and place the board on top of the anti-static bag it came in. Gently lift the CPU socket lever and align your CPU so the golden triangle on the corner matches the triangle on the socket. Carefully place it in—don't force it—and lower the retention arm back down to lock it into place.                
                <br><br>                
                <b>Step 3: Install the CPU Cooler</b><br>
                If you're using the stock cooler that came with your CPU, it likely already has thermal paste pre-applied. If you're using an aftermarket cooler, you may need to apply a pea-sized dot of thermal paste to the center of the CPU first. Mount the cooler according to the instructions that came with it, then plug the fan into the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 4: Install the RAM</b><br>
                Find the RAM slots on the motherboard and check your manual to see which slots to use if you're installing two sticks. Push the tabs on the sides of the slots outward. Line up the notch on your RAM stick with the slot, then press down firmly until it clicks into place on both sides.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 5: Install M.2 SSD (If You Have One)</b><br>
                If you're using an M.2 SSD, locate the M.2 slot on your motherboard. Remove the screw, insert the SSD at an angle, then gently push it down flat and secure it with the screw. It should sit snugly in place.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 6: Place the Motherboard in the Case</b><br>
                Before placing the motherboard in the case, install the I/O shield (the metal rectangle that fits around your ports) into the back of the case. It just snaps in from the inside. Then gently lower the motherboard into the case, lining it up with the standoff screws. Use the screws that came with the case to secure the board in place.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 7: Install the Power Supply (PSU)</b><br>
                Slide the PSU into the bottom (or top, depending on your case) and align it with the screw holes on the back of the case. Screw it in, then begin plugging in the necessary cables: the 24-pin motherboard cable, the 8-pin CPU power cable, and any cables for your GPU and storage devices. Don't plug them in just yet—just get them ready.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 8: Install Storage Drives (SSD or HDD)</b><br>
                If you're using a 2.5” SSD or a 3.5” hard drive, mount them in the drive bays or brackets in your case. Use the provided screws or tool-free mounts. Then connect one SATA data cable from the drive to the motherboard and a SATA power cable from the PSU to the drive.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 9: Install the Graphics Card (GPU)</b><br>
                Find the top PCIe slot on your motherboard (usually closest to the CPU). Remove the case's expansion slot covers where the GPU ports will stick out, then firmly insert the GPU into the slot until it clicks. Secure it with screws, then plug in any necessary PCIe power cables from the PSU.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 10: Connect Front Panel Cables</b><br>
                This step can be a little tricky, but don't worry. Find the small front panel connectors from your case (power button, reset button, power LED, etc.) and plug them into the motherboard's front panel header, usually labeled F_PANEL. Your motherboard manual will show the exact layout. Also connect USB and audio front panel headers (USB2, USB3, HD_AUDIO) to their labeled ports.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 11: Double-Check All Connections</b><br>
                Go over everything: Is the CPU cooler connected? Are all power cables plugged in—24-pin, 8-pin CPU, GPU power, SATA? Are the RAM sticks seated properly? Are case fans connected to the motherboard? A quick check here can save hours of troubleshooting later.
                <br><br>
                <b>Step 12: Boot Up and Enter BIOS</b><br>
                Plug your monitor into the GPU, connect your keyboard, and plug in the power cable. Flip the PSU switch to “|” and press the power button on the case. If everything is working, your fans should spin, and you should see the motherboard splash screen. Press the BIOS key (usually DEL or F2) to enter the BIOS. From here, make sure your RAM and storage drives are detected.
                <br><br>                
                <b>Step 13: Install the Operating System</b><br>
                Insert a bootable USB drive with Windows or your OS of choice. Follow the on-screen instructions to install it to your SSD or hard drive. Once that's done, install your motherboard drivers and GPU drivers. You're almost done!
                <br><br>                
                <b>Step 14: Organize Cables and Close the Case</b><br>
                Take a few minutes to tidy up your cables using zip ties or Velcro straps. This not only looks cleaner but helps with airflow. Once everything's neat, close up your side panels and screw them into place.
                <br><br>
                <b>Congratulations! You've Built Your PC</b><br>
                Take a moment to admire your work—you just built a computer from scratch! Now you can install your favorite games or software, customize your desktop, and enjoy the satisfaction of using something you built with your own hands.
