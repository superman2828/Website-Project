            <h2>Other Components:</h2>
                <div id="Case">
                    <h3>Case</h3>
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> The case, also known as the chassis or tower, is the physical shell that holds all of your PC's components. While it might seem like just a box, the case plays a big role in keeping your parts protected, organized, and cool. It also influences the overall look and feel of your build. Cases come in different sizes—such as Full Tower, Mid Tower, and Mini-ITX—which affect what parts will fit inside and how much room you have to work with. Some cases have tempered glass side panels for showcasing your build, while others prioritize airflow and minimalism. It's the component you'll be looking at the most, so choosing one that matches your style and needs is important.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommendations:</b> When choosing a case, make sure it supports the size of your motherboard and leaves enough room for your graphics card, CPU cooler, and any extra fans you might install. A case with good airflow is essential for keeping your components cool—look for mesh fronts, multiple fan mounts, and dust filters. Tool-less designs and good cable management features, like routing holes and Velcro straps, can also make the building process easier. Great starter cases include the NZXT H510 for a clean, modern look, the Fractal Design Meshify C for excellent airflow, and the Lian Li Lancool II for builder-friendly features. Picking the right case can make your build look great, stay cool, and be a lot more enjoyable to put together.</p>

                <div id="Fans">
                    <h3>Fans</h3>
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> Fans are essential for keeping your PC cool and preventing components from overheating. They help move hot air out of the case and bring cooler air in, creating better airflow inside your build. Most cases come with one or two pre-installed fans, but you may need to add more depending on your setup, especially if you're using powerful components or planning to overclock. Fans come in different sizes, usually 120mm or 140mm, and can be mounted in the front, top, rear, or bottom of your case depending on its layout. Proper fan placement can drastically improve your system's temperature and overall performance.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommendations:</b> When shopping for fans, look at factors like airflow (measured in CFM), noise levels (measured in dBA), and whether they use RGB lighting for added style. You'll also need to check how your fans connect—some use 3-pin connectors while others use 4-pin PWM for more precise control through your motherboard. Popular and reliable fan brands include Noctua (known for quiet, high-performance fans), Corsair (especially for RGB setups), and Arctic (great performance for the price). Don't forget to consider fan orientation: intake fans should be placed where they bring cool air in, usually at the front or bottom, while exhaust fans push hot air out the back or top.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="Cooler">
                    <h3>CPU Cooler</h3>
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> A CPU cooler keeps your processor from overheating by transferring heat away from the CPU and dispersing it with a fan or liquid cooling system. Every CPU generates heat when it's working, and without a good cooler, it can slow down or shut off to protect itself. There are two main types of CPU coolers: air coolers and liquid (AIO) coolers. Air coolers use a large metal heatsink and one or more fans to push heat away, while AIO liquid coolers circulate a special liquid to a radiator that cools it off. Both types have their pros and cons, but either can keep your CPU running safely if chosen correctly.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommendations:</b> When picking a cooler, make sure it's compatible with your CPU socket and fits inside your case—some coolers can be quite large. If you're not overclocking, a decent air cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition will work just fine. For higher-end builds or overclocking, an AIO like the NZXT Kraken X63 or Corsair H100i is a solid choice. Keep in mind that many CPUs come with stock coolers, but upgrading can lead to quieter operation and lower temps, especially under heavy loads. Also, make sure your case supports the radiator size if you go the AIO route.</p>

                <div id="WiFi">
                    <h3>WiFi</h3>
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> While many gaming and workstation PCs use a wired Ethernet connection for speed and stability, Wi-Fi is still a convenient option—especially if your setup is far from your router. Not all motherboards come with built-in Wi-Fi, so you may need to add it separately if you need wireless access. Wi-Fi connectivity comes either in the form of PCIe cards that install directly into your motherboard or USB Wi-Fi adapters that plug into a port on the back of your PC. Each option has its advantages depending on your needs and the quality of your home network.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommendations:</b> If you're gaming or streaming and need a fast, stable connection, a PCIe Wi-Fi card with antennas (like the TP-Link Archer TXE75E or ASUS PCE-AX58BT) will typically give you better speed and range. Many newer cards also support Bluetooth, which is useful for connecting wireless headphones, controllers, or keyboards. USB Wi-Fi adapters are cheaper and easier to install, though they often don't offer the same performance. If you want to future-proof your setup, look for cards that support Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E for faster speeds and more reliable connections.</p>

                <div id="Cables">
                    <h3>Cables</h3>
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> Cables may not be the most exciting part of a PC build, but they're essential for connecting everything and powering your system. Your power supply comes with cables for the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and storage drives. Data cables, like SATA cables, connect storage devices like hard drives and SATA SSDs to the motherboard. Case cables handle things like power buttons, USB ports, and audio jacks on the front panel. Managing all of these cables properly helps airflow and keeps your build looking clean and organized.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommendations:</b> When planning your build, make sure your power supply includes all the cables you'll need, especially if you're using a modular or semi-modular PSU. It's also worth picking up extra SATA cables if your motherboard doesn't come with enough. To keep things tidy, use zip ties, Velcro straps, or cable combs for routing and organizing cables. If you want a clean aesthetic, consider custom cable extensions from brands like CableMod—they come in various colors and can make your build stand out. A little cable management goes a long way toward making your build easier to maintain and nicer to look at.</p>

                <div id="Misc">
                    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
                    <p><b>What it is:</b> There are a few other small but helpful items that can improve your PC building experience. An anti-static wrist strap is a useful tool that grounds you while working on your build, helping prevent static electricity from damaging sensitive components. While not absolutely necessary, it adds peace of mind, especially for first-time builders. Flashlights or a headlamp can be helpful in dim lighting, and having some compressed air on hand is great for keeping dust out of your system during and after the build.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommendations:</b> Other handy extras include thermal paste (especially if your CPU cooler doesn't come with any pre-applied), a magnetic parts tray to hold screws, and extra case screws or zip ties for cable management. It's also helpful to have a small notepad or checklist to track which cables are connected and what parts you've installed. These little details might not seem critical, but they can make your building process smoother and more organized. Having the right tools and supplies on hand means you're less likely to run into frustrating moments and more likely to enjoy the build from start to finish.</p>
